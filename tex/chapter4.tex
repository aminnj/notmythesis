\chapter{Background estimation}

There are three main classes of backgrounds that survive the inclusive SUSY or
\smft analysis baseline selections: backgrounds with two or more prompt leptons
in the final state (giving a real SS pair), backgrounds with at least one nonprompt lepton,
and backgrounds that actually have an OS pair with one lepton having misreconstructed charge.

The first class of backgrounds produce prompt leptons
but are relatively ``rare'' (have low cross section) and are estimated from
simulation, with appropriate correction factors and uncertainties to be discussed in the next
sections. This class can be further subdivided by the physical process:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Diboson}: \\ \WZ, \ZZ, \WW, \WH, \ZH, \Zgamma, \Wgamma, and \WpWp
    \item \textbf{Triboson}: \\ \WWW, \WWZ, \WZZ, \ZZZ, \WWgamma, and \WZgamma
    \item \textbf{Single top quark and bosons}: \\ \tgamma, \tZgamma, and \tWZ
    \item \textbf{Top quark pair and one boson}: \\ \ttW, \ttZ, \ttH, and \ttgamma
    \item \textbf{Top quark pair and two bosons}: \\ \ttWW, \ttWZ, \ttZZ, \ttWH, \ttZH, and \ttHH
    \item \textbf{Triple top quark}: \\ \ttt and \tttW
    \item \textbf{Four top quarks}: \\ \tttt
\end{itemize}

In the \smft analysis, \tttt is, of course, considered a signal instead of a background.
Contributions from the first two categories of physical processes are negligible for the
\smft analysis due to the $\Nbjets\geq 2$ requirement in the baseline selections.

The second class of background events consist of events where one of the leptons is
``nonprompt'', or more colloquially, ``fake''. That is, the fake lepton is
either a real lepton which is a decay product of a heavy flavor hadron (\PQb 
or \PQc quark), or simply a misidentified hadron. The dominant sources of fake leptons
are the large cross section processes of $\ttjets$ and $\wjets$. This class is more
tricky to only use simulation, and a data-driven method is used instead.

The last class of backgrounds consists of those with a charge-misidentified lepton, or,
more colloquially ``flips'', which essentially
converts an OS pair into a SS pair. Thus, the biggest source of this background is 
the highest cross-section OS process: DY. Similarly to
the nonprompt background, this background uses a data-driven method instead of 
relying completely on simulation.

\section{Prompt SM}

The large set of physics processes listed in the previous section as prompt SM processes
are estimated from simulation and are grouped into larger categories, singling out
specific processes which are important to either  the inclusive SUSY analysis
or the \smft analysis. The process categories and constitutent physics processes/simulations
are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ``$\mathbf{\ttW}$'': \ttW
    \item ``$\mathbf{\ttZ}$'': \ttZ
    \item ``$\mathbf{\ttH}$'': \ttH
    \item ``$\mathbf{\Xgamma}$'': \Wgamma, \Zgamma, \ttgamma, and \tgamma
\end{itemize}

And for the \smft analysis, there are two additional categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``\textbf{Rare}'': \ttt, \tttW, \ZZ, \WH, \ZH, \WZgamma, \WWgamma, \tZgamma, \tWZ, \WpWp, \WZ, and \WW
    \item ``$\mathbf{\ttVV}$'': \ttWW, \ttWZ, \ttZZ, \ttWH, \ttZH, and \ttHH
\end{itemize}

Or, for the inclusive SUSY analysis, there are three additional categories:
\begin{itemize}
    \item ``\textbf{Rare}'': \ttt, \tttW, \ZZ, \WW, \WH, \ZH, \WZgamma, \WWgamma, \tZgamma, \tWZ, \ttWW, \ttWZ, \ttZZ, \ttWH, \ttZH, \ttHH, and \tttt
    \item ``\textbf{WZ}'': \WZ
    \item ``\textbf{WW}'': \WpWp
\end{itemize}

Two important processes for the \smft search are \ttW and \ttZ, which have cross sections
of 630\ifb and 840\ifb~\cite{CMS:Sirunyan2017uzs}, respectively, almost a couple orders of magnitude larger than that of
\tttt (12\ifb).

A breakdown of the individual processes of the ``Rare'' category in the 
\smft analysis signal regions
is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ftraressr}, split into multi-top quark and multi-boson
processes.

Since many of these processes have not been experimentally observed or measured,
we apply conservative normalization uncertainties based on theoretical calculations of 50\% on
Rare and \Xgamma categories for the SUSY analysis, or 30\% for other categories.

    \caption{ Relative composition of multi-top (top) and multi-boson (bottom) rare backgrounds in the signal regions for all MC.}
    \label{fig:ftraressr}
\end{figure}

For the \smft analysis,
we apply uncertainties of 20\%, 11\%, and 11\% for Rare, \Xgamma, and \ttVV categories,
respectively, and 40\% for the \ttW and \ttZ categories. Also in the \smft analysis,
the \ttH category is assigned an uncertainty of 25\% to reflect the CMS \ttH 
measurement~\cite{CMS:Sirunyan2018hoz} which obtained a signal strength $\mu_{\ttH}$, defined
as the ratio between the measured $\ttH$ cross section and its SM expectation,
of $1.26^{+0.31}_{-0.26}$.

\section{Nonprompt leptons}


Estimating the background from fake leptons requires care as simply
using fake leptons out of the box from simulation makes heavy assumptions on 
the accuracy of the simulation. It is better to somehow use data itself to estimate
the fake leptons from data.  We use the ``fake rate'', or ``tight-loose'', method
to estimate this background in a data-driven fashion via an extrapolation.

Recalling the two working points for lepton identification/isolation, loose and tight,
we use an orthogonal sideband (``application region'') of tight-loose-not-tight SS dilepton events 
(where one lepton is tight and the other is loose but not tight)
to estimate the fake contribution in the SRs (tight-tight SS dilepton events). 

The application region events can be weighted by a ``tight-to-loose'' ratio
(the probability for a loose non-prompt lepton to also pass the tight lepton selections)
to form the SR prediction. Defining $f$ as this probability, the fake contribution
in the SRs, $\mathrm{N}_\text{TT, fake}$  is given by
\begin{equation}
  N_\text{TT, fake} = \left(\frac{f}{1-f}\right) N_\text{TL}
  - \left(\frac{f}{1-f}\right)^2 N_\text{LL}
\end{equation}
where $N_\text{TL}$ represents the number of events in the application region
and $N_\text{LL}$ represents a similar, but smaller, application region where both
leptons pass the loose lepton selections but not the tight selections. The probability 
$f$ is parameterized by a modified lepton \pt (\ptcorr), lepton $\eta$, lepton flavor ($e$ or $\mu$),
data collection year, and trigger strategy (isolated, non-isolated). The minus sign
is needed for this ``double fake'' contribution to avoid overcounting (since
both tight-loose and loose-tight events are present in the application region and 
are extrapolated to the signal regions).

Now, unsurprisingly, $f \equiv f(\ptcorr,\eta)$ is measured in the ``measurement region''.
The measurement region is a sample of QCD multijet events, and thus, 
enriched in non-prompt leptons, with an event selection of
\begin{itemize}
\item specific auxiliary trigger, listed in Table~\ref{tab:frtrigs}
\item only one loose/denominator lepton (``fakeable object''/``FO'')
\item at least one jet with $\Delta R(\mathrm{jet},\mathrm{FO})>1$
\item $\ptmiss<20\GeV$
\item $\MT<20\GeV$
\end{itemize}
to make sure we select as much QCD in data in possible while minimizing
the amount of prompt leptons leaking into the measurement region.
Due to different trigger requirements and data collection periods, we derive
a total of 12 versions of the 2-dimensional \pt-$\eta$-binned fake rate
(electrons/muons, isolated triggers/non-isolated triggers, 2016/2017/2018)

We use a corrected lepton \pt, \ptcorr, to parameterize the fake rate
estimation in the fake rate estimation in order to reduce the dependency to
the mother parton \pt and the flavor composition of the
sample~\cite{CMS:AN14261}:

\begin{equation}
  \ptcorr = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            \pt \cdot (1+\max(0,I_\mathrm{mini}-I_1)) & \quad \text{if} \,\,\, \ptrel > I_3 \\[10pt]
            \max(\pt,\pt(\mathrm{jet}) \cdot I_2) & \quad \text{if} \,\,\, \ptrel \leq I_3
        \end{array}
      \right.
\end{equation}


While the requirements on \ptmiss and \MT suppress the
contribution from prompt leptons in the measurement region,
residual contributions from DY/\wjets/\ttjets (electroweak contamination)
need to be estimated and subtracted properly from the fake rate.
For this, we use simulation, but normalize in a high \MT/\ptmiss region.
Since the fake rate $f$ is the ratio of the number of tight leptons
to the number of loose leptons ($f=N_\mathrm{T}/N_\mathrm{L}$)
in the measurement region, we need to calculate $k$ for this region
($\MT>30\GeV$, $\ptmiss>30\GeV$) 
region and subtract from the numerator and denominator:
\begin{equation}
  f = \frac{N_\mathrm{T} - k \cdot N_\mathrm{T}^\text{EWK}}{N_\mathrm{L} - k \cdot N_\mathrm{L}^\text{EWK}}
\end{equation}
where $N^\text{EWK}$ represents the electroweak contamination.
These correction factors, $k$, are obtained by fitting the sum of two templates
derived from MC, one for QCD and one for the sum of electroweak processes
(DY, \wjets, \ttjets). The normalization of the elctroweak processes is extracted
from the fit and yields $k$. Since the shape of the non-prompt component
might not be well-modeled, we performa cross-check by repeating the fit and replacing the QCD
MC template with a data-drive template from events failing the isolation requirements.
The nominal and alternative fits for electrons and muons are shown in 
Fig.~\ref{fig:EWKnormalization2017iso} for 2017 data with isolated triggers, for example.
The resulting normalization corrections for the the full set of years and both trigger types
are shown in Table~\ref{tab:ewkfits}.

Two-dimensional fake rate maps for isolated triggers for 2017 data and QCD simulation
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:QCDFRMuEleRaw2017iso}.
One can see that prior to the electroweak subtraction, the fake rates increase drastically
at high lepton \pt. This is expected, as the probability for true/prompt leptons
from electroweak proceesses to pass the tight selection is large (Otherwise our lepton
selections would not be doing their job in the first place.)
To better visualize the fake rates, 
one-dimensional projections onto the \ptcorr axis for each of the three years
are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:QCDFRMuEle2016isoandnoniso}, \ref{fig:QCDFRMuEle2017isoandnoniso},
and \ref{fig:QCDFRMuEle2018isoandnoniso}. One sees good agreement between
the data-driven fake rate and fake rate calculated directly with QCD MC, though
this is not at all expected or needed. Also note the large uncertainties at high \ptcorr,
which is due to the uncertainty associated with the electroweak subtraction procedure.

We test the closure of this method in simulation after making the inclusive
SUSY analysis baseline selection for various kinematic distributions in
\ref{fig:QCDFakesAll2017}. The filled histograms are events with one lepton
matched to a prompt lepton at generator lepton and another lepton not matched
to a prompt lepton (prompt-nonprompt events), separately for \ttjets and
\wjets simulation samples. The histogram with black points represents
application region events (one tight lepton and one loose-not-tight lepton,
at reconstruction-level) which are reweighted by the fake rate transfer
factor to form a prediction. The level of closure observed in the plots is
typically at 30\% or better, motivating a corresponding 30\% normalization
systematic uncertainty on the nonprompt lepton background.

\section{Charge misidentification}

The charge misidentification/flip background results from events that have
isolated OS leptons where the charge of one of the leptons is
misidentified due to mismeasurement (typical at high \pt) or bremsstrahlung.
Muons are relatively well-measured and less susceptible to radiation due to their
mass, so charge flips of muons are neglected compared to electrons.

The charge flip background is estimated by selecting OS $ee$ or $e\mu$ events 
which pass the appropriate baseline selection depending on analysis,
and then weighting the events by the \pt and $\eta$-dependent 
probability of electron charge mismeasurement, which is calculated from simulation.

The two-dimensional probability maps, shown for each of the three years of data collection 
in Fig.~\ref{fig:fliprate}, are obtained from a combination of
\ttbar and DY simulation. The probabilities
are then validated using a control sample in data of
SS $\PZ\rightarrow e^\pm e^\pm$ baseline events, 
instead using a $\ptmiss<50\GeV$ requirement to be
orthogonal to the signal regions. 
The level of disagreement in this control region
is used to assess the associated systematic uncertainty and to derive a
correction to the MC-based rate estimation.  In the 2016 data sample, we find good
agreement between prediction and data in the control region.
However, in the 2017 and 2018 data samples, the MC-based flip rate
is significantly lower than for
2016 due to the upgraded pixel detector (which added an extra inner pixel layer),
so the obsered number of events in the
SS $\PZ\rightarrow e^\pm e^\pm$ region is found to be nearly 40\% higher than the
predicted number of events. Consequently, the 2017 and 2018 charge
flip predictions are scaled up by approximately 40\%, as seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:flipclosure}. These year-by-year correction factors are summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:flipscaling}. Since we do not observe significant trends
in the lepton kinematics, we do not consider \pt and $\eta$-binned
corrections on top of the tabulated flat correction factors. 
In addition to the statistical uncertainties, we apply a 20\%
systematic uncertainty on this background prediction for all years. In MC, the
flip rate for muons is found to be an order of magnitude smaller than for
electrons and is therefore neglected, as it would in any case be covered by
the systematic uncertainty of 20\% on this background.

\section{Corrections}
\mytodo{todo}

In addition to corrections associated with JEC, \PQb-tagging, lepton scale factors,
and trigger scale factors, mentioned throughout previous sections and chapters, we
apply some dedicated corrections to simulation to bring better agreement between data
and simulation.

\mytodo{ttbb}
\mytodo{nisr}

\subsection{ttbb/ttjj}

  To improve the modeling of the flavor of additional jets, the \ttW, \ttZ
  and \ttH simulation is also corrected to account for the measured ratio of
  $\ttbar \bbbar / \ttbar jj$ cross sec reported in TOP-16-010

\subsection{ISR/FSR jet multiplicity}

To improve on the MadGraph modeling of the
multiplicity of additional jets from initial-state radiation (ISR) and
final-state radiation (FSR),
 \ttW and \ttZ MC events are reweighted based on the
number of ISR or FSR jets ($\Njets^{\rm ISR/FSR}$).
NOTE from paper about why no TTH NOTE.
The reweighing is based on the Data/MC ratio in the light-flavor jet
multiplicity in dilepton \ttbar events (using MadGraph MC), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:isrweight}
and described in Ref.~\cite{CMS:isrweight} for 2016 Data and MC.
The method requires exactly two b-tagged jets, and assumes that all other jets are ISR or FSR.
The reweighting factors vary between 0.86 and 0.77 for
$\Njets^{\rm ISR/FSR}$ between 1 and 4 (where dilepton ttV plus 4 ISR/FSR jets results in \Njets=8, corresponding to our highest SR bin).
For 2017 MC, new weights were derived since the MC uses a new Pythia tune.
The corresponding Data/MC ratios are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:isrweight2}, where the different plots
are based on different number of partons simulated at the matrix element.
Reweighting factors are applied to \ttW, \ttZ, and \ttbar (from inclusive sample reweighting).
Following the procedure used in the SUSY group,
we take one half of the deviation
from unity as the systematic uncertainty in these reweighting factors.

As introduced in Section~\ref{sec:samples}, \ttW and \ttZ MC events are reweighted based on $N_J^{\rm ISR/FSR}$, and a
systematic corresponding to half of the reweighting factor deviation from unity is used (Section~\ref{sec:systematics}).

The size of the systematic comes from deviations observed in an orthogonal single-lepton channel.

The tunes for 2016 (TuneCUETP8M1) and 2017/2018 (TuneCP5) are different, so both need to be checked separately. For the case of 2016,
the study documented in Ref.~\cite{CMS:isrweight} 
assesses a systematic of half of the reweighting factor deviation from unity.
Below, we check the 2018 dataset explicitly to verify this is also the case for the new tune, TuneCP5.

Following Ref.~\cite{CMS:isrweight}, 
we make a tight single-lepton selection with analysis jet, b-tagging, and lepton selections.
Selected events have lepton $\pt>25\GeV$, $\ptmiss>50\GeV$, $\HT>300\GeV$, and 2 b tagged jets. MC integral is normalized to
data to account for trigger and lepton scale factors.

Figure~\ref{fig:isrweightsyst} shows the jet multiplicity distribution for 2018 data/MC before (left) and after (right)
applying the 2018-derived reweighting factors. The systematic uncertainty of half of the deviation from unity covers
variations present in the reweighted single lepton jet multiplicity distributions for the updated TuneCP5.
