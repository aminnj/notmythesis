Two related searches for Standard Model and beyond the Standard Model physics
    with a final state containing a pair of same-charged leptons and jets are
    performed using a sample of \sthirteen data corresponding to an integrated
    luminosity of 137~\ifb, collected by the CMS detector between 2016 and
    2018. The first inclusive search observes no excess above the Standard
    Model and thus places constraints on R-parity violating and R-parity
    conserving supersymmetric models with pair production of gluinos and
    squarks.  Gluino masses are excluded up to 2.1 TeV, while top and bottom
    squarks are excluded up to 0.9 TeV.  The second search measures the
    cross-section of the production of four top quarks within the Standard
    Model using both cut-based and multivariate approaches.  The observed
    (expected) significance of the multivariate approach is 2.6 (2.7) standard
    deviations, with a measured cross-section of $12.6^{+5.8}_{-5.2}$ fb,
    consistent with the Standard Model prediction of $12.0^{+2.2}_{-2.5}$ fb.
    These results are translated into constraints on the Yukawa coupling of the
    top quark, as well as constraints on heavy scalar or pseudoscalar
    production in a type II 2HDM scenario.
