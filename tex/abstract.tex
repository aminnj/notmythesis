Two related searches for Standard Model and inclusive beyond the Standard
Model physics with a final state containing a pair of same-charged leptons
and jets are performed using a sample of \sthirteen data corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 137~\ifb, collected by the CMS detector between 2016
and 2018. The inclusive search observes no excess above the Standard Model
and thus places constraints on supersymmetric models with pair production of
gluinos and squarks. Gluino masses are excluded up to 2.1 TeV, while top and
bottom squarks are excluded up to 0.9 TeV. The Standard Model search measures
the cross-section of the production of four top quarks using both cut-based
and multivariate approaches. The observed (expected) significance of the
multivariate approach is 2.6 (2.7) standard deviations, with a measured
cross-section of $12.6^{+5.8}_{-5.2}$ fb, consistent with the Standard Model
prediction of $12.0^{+2.2}_{-2.5}$ fb. These results are translated into
constraints on the Yukawa coupling of the top quark, heavy scalar or
pseudoscalar production in a type II 2HDM scenario or models of dark matter,
couplings between the top quark and new light particles, and
the Higgs boson oblique parameter.
