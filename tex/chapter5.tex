\section{SUSY results}
\label{sec:ssresults}
\mytodo{to reword}

The distributions of the variables used to define the SRs after the event selection are
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:kinem}.
Background yields shown as stacked histograms in Figs.~\ref{fig:kinem}, \ref{fig:SRrun2}, and \ref{fig:SRrun2b} are
those determined following baseline selections for the inclusive SUSY analysis.
The overall data yields exceed expectation by an amount close to the systematic uncertainty.
However, no particular trend that is not covered by the uncertainties discussed in the previous sections,
is seen in the distributions.
The significance of the excess is of similar magnitude in all categories, with a maximum of around 2 standard deviations (s.d.) in the off-\PZ ML category. 

The results of the search, broken down by SR,
are presented in Figs.~\ref{fig:SRrun2} and~\ref{fig:SRrun2b}.
Expected background event yields, total uncertainties, and observed event yields in the SRs used in this search
are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:slimyields}.
No significant deviation with respect to the SM background prediction is observed.
The largest excess of events found by fitting the data with the background-only
hypothesis is in HH SR54,
corresponding to a local significance of 2.6 s.d.
Its neighboring bin, HH SR55, which is adjacent along the \HT dimension, has a
deficit of events in the data corresponding to a
significance of $1.8$ s.d.

\section{SUSY interpretations}
\label{sec:ssinterpretations}

\subsection{Model-dependent}
\mytodo{to reword}

These results are then interpreted as experimental constraints on the cross sections for
the various signal models. For each model,
event yields in all SRs are used to obtain exclusion limits
on the production cross section at 95\% confidence level (\CL) with
an asymptotic formulation of the modified frequentist \CLs
criterion~\cite{STAT:Junk1999kv,STAT:Read2002hq,STAT:ATLPHYSPUB2011011,STAT:Cowan2010js},
where uncertainties are incorporated as nuisance parameters and profiled~\cite{STAT:ATLPHYSPUB2011011}.
This procedure takes advantage of the differences in the distribution of events amongst the SR between the various SM backgrounds and the signal considered.
The normalizations of the various backgrounds are in particular allowed to float within their uncertainties in the global fit, resulting in several backgrounds (nonprompt lepton, $\ttbar \PW/\PZ/\PH$ and rare processes) being pulled up by around $1$ s.d. for most of the signal points considered, which are often characterized by a distinctive distribution of events across the SRs. 
This observation is consistent with the current measurements of $\ttbar \PW$ and $\ttbar \PZ$ processes performed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations~\cite{ATLAS:ttV,CMS:ttV}.
The limits obtained are then used together with the theoretical cross section
calculations to exclude regions of SUSY parameter space.


Figure~\ref{fig:t1ttxx_scan_xsec} shows observed and expected exclusion limits
for simplified models of gluino pair production with each gluino decaying
to off- or on-shell third-generation squarks,
\Totttt, \TfttbbWW, \Tftttt, and \Tfttcc.
Similarly, Figs.~\ref{fig:t5qqqqvv_scan_xsec} and~\ref{fig:t5qqqqww_scan_xsec} show the corresponding limits for \TfqqqqWZ and \TfqqqqWW, with
two different assumptions on the chargino mass.
Note that the \TfqqqqWZ model assumes equal probabilities for
the decay of the gluino into \chiplus, \chiminus, and \neutralinotwo.
The exclusion limits for \TsttWW and \TsttHZ are displayed in
Figs.~\ref{fig:t6ttww_scan_xsec} and~\ref{fig:t6tthz_scan_xsec},
respectively.
In the \TsttHZ model, the heavier top squark decays
into a lighter top squark and a \PZ\ or \PH\ boson. The three
sets of exclusion limits shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:t6tthz_scan_xsec}
correspond to the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(\susytoptwo\to\susytopone\PZ)$ having values of
0, 50, and 100\%.

Finally, Fig.~\ref{fig:rpvlimits} shows observed and expected limits on
the cross section of gluino pair production as a function of the gluino masses in
the two RPV models.
The observed and expected exclusions on the gluino mass are similar and reach 2.1 and 1.7 \TeV for the \ToqqqqL and \Totbs models, respectively.

The analysis sensitivity for the various models studied in Figs.~\ref{fig:t1ttxx_scan_xsec}--\ref{fig:t6tthz_scan_xsec} is often driven by the event yields in a few SRs (off-\PZ ML21, HH53 and HH52), where a slight excess of data is observed.
This in particular applies to the uncompressed mass regime, resulting in an observed limit weaker than the expected one by one or two s.d.
In the compressed mass regime, however, other SRs can become dominant, for example when the hadronic activity becomes limited. 
This happens in the \TfqqqqWZ and \TfqqqqWW models where the gluino and the lightest neutralino present a limited mass splitting (the region close to the diagonal in the left plots of Figs.~\ref{fig:t5qqqqvv_scan_xsec} and ~\ref{fig:t5qqqqww_scan_xsec}). In those scenarios the on-\PZ ML4 and HH3 SRs provide the best sensitivity, respectively. 
Additionally, if the intermediate chargino is nearly degenerate in mass with the lightest neutralino, both leptons become soft and LL SRs such as LL2 become relevant. Such a situation is encountered in the phase space region close to the diagonal in the right plots of Figs.~\ref{fig:t5qqqqvv_scan_xsec} and ~\ref{fig:t5qqqqww_scan_xsec}.
On-\PZ SRs (especially on-\PZ ML23) become important for models where an on-shell \PZ boson is produced (bottom plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:t6tthz_scan_xsec}).
The limits on the RPV models presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:rpvlimits} are mostly driven by another set of SRs (HH62 and LM11, the latter becoming more relevant for lower masses).


Compared to the previous versions of the
analysis~\cite{CMS:mySUS2016,CMS:SUS16041}, the limits for the RPC models
extend the gluino and squark mass observed and expected exclusions by up to
200\GeV because of the increase in the integrated luminosity and the
corresponding re-optimization of SR definitions. These results also
complement searches for gluino pair production conducted by CMS in final
states with 0 or 1
lepton~\cite{CMS:2019tlp,CMS:Sirunyan2019ctn,CMS:Sirunyan2019xwh}. 
For the \Totttt
scenario, the expected sensitivity of this analysis suffers from a lower
branching fraction that makes it uncompetitive in the uncompressed mass
regime. However, for a nearly degenerate mass spectrum, the SM background
becomes of higher importance and the presence of an SS lepton pair
significantly reduces it, leading to a similar sensitivity. The constraints
on the two RPV models that were not previously included demonstrate the
sensitivity of the analysis to RPV scenarios. The final state is particularly
well suited to study the \ToqqqqL model since no leptonic branching fraction
penalty applies, resulting in exclusion limits on the gluino mass beyond 2.1
TeV, comparable to other results in fully hadronic final
states~\cite{CMS:Sirunyan2019ctn,CMS:Sirunyan2019xwh}. The limits obtained on the
\Totbs model are stronger than those previously obtained in the one-lepton
channel based on the analysis of the 2016 dataset~\cite{CMS:Sirunyan2017dhe}.
They are expected to remain competitive after an update with the full Run 2
dataset.

\subsection{Model-independent}

For the generic production of an SS lepton pair with at least two jets and
$\HT>300\GeV$, we set model-independent limits on the product of cross section, branching fraction,
detector acceptance, and reconstruction efficiency.
To do this, we select events from the HH and LM categories and calculate limits
as a function of either the minimum \ptmiss or \HT requirements starting at 
300 and 1400\GeV, respectively. Because there is an overlap between the two conditions,
events that are selected for the limits as a function of \HT must also have 
$\ptmiss<300\GeV$. Both sets of limits are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:milimits}.

In order to assist with future reinterpretations of the inclusive same-sign
search results shown here, we calculated the expected and observed yields for
a set of inclusive SRs, shown in Table~\ref{tab:inclusive_aggregate}. The
last column in the table indicates the upper limit at 95\% \CL on the number
of BSM events in each SR. The SRs are defiend to have on the order of 5 to 10
expected background events, and we focus on events with large \HT, \ptmiss,
\Nbjets, and/or \Njets. No uncertainty in the signal acceptance is assumed in
calculating the limits in the table.

Distributions of the main kinematic variables (\Njets, \Nbjets, \HT, and
\ptmiss) for events in the four top analysis baseline region are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:kinemsr} and compared
to the SM background predictions. The \Njets and \Nbjets distributions for
the CRW and CRZ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:kinemcr}. The expected SM \tttt
signal, normalized to its predicted cross section, is shown in both figures.
The SM predictions are statistically consistent with the observations.

A binned likelihood is constructed using the yields from the signal regions,
the CRZ, as well as the CRW for the cut-based analysis only, incorporating
experimental and theoretical uncertainties as ``nuisance'' parameters. 
The measured cross
section for \tttt and the significance of the observation relative to the
background-only hypothesis are obtained from a profile maximum-likelihood
fit, in which the parameter of interest is \xsectttt and all nuisance
parameters are profiled, following the procedures described in
Refs.~\cite{STAT:ATLPHYSPUB2011011,STAT:PDG}. In addition, an upper limit at 95\%
confidence level (\CL) is set on \xsectttt using the modified frequentist
\CLs criterion~\cite{STAT:Junk1999kv,STAT:Read2002hq}, with the profile likelihood
ratio test statistic and asymptotic approximation~\cite{STAT:Cowan2010js}. We
verified the consistency between the asymptotic and fully toy-based methods.
Alternatively, by considering the SM, including the \tttt process with the SM
cross section and uncertainty~\cite{THEORY:Frederix2017wme}, as the null
hypothesis, the fit provides cross section upper limits on BSM processes with
new scalar and pseudoscalar particles.

The values and uncertainties of most nuisance parameters are unchanged by the
fit, but the ones significantly affected include those corresponding to the
\ttW and \ttZ normalizations, which are both scaled by $1.3\pm0.2$ by the
fit, in agreement with the ATLAS and CMS measurements of these
processes~\cite{ATLAS:Aaboud2019njj, CMS:Sirunyan2017uzs, CMS:2019too}. The
predicted yields after the maximum-likelihood fit (post-fit) are compared to
data in Fig.~\ref{fig:srcr} for the cut-based (upper) and BDT (lower)
analyses, where the fitted \tttt signal contribution is added to the
background predictions. The corresponding yields are shown in
Tables~\ref{tab:srcryields} and \ref{tab:srdiscyields} for the cut-based and
BDT analysis, respectively.

The \tttt cross section and the 68\% \CL interval is measured to be
$9.4^{+6.2}_{-5.6}\unit{fb}$ in the cut-based analysis, and
$12.6^{+5.8}_{-5.2}\unit{fb}$ in the BDT analysis. Relative to the
background-only hypothesis, the observed and expected significances are 1.7
and 2.5 standard deviations, respectively, for the cut-based analysis, and
2.6 and 2.7 standard deviations for the BDT analysis. The observed 95\% \CL
upper limits on the cross section are $20.0\unit{fb}$ in the cut-based and
$22.5\unit{fb}$ in the BDT analyses. The corresponding expected upper limits
on the \tttt cross section, assuming no SM \tttt contribution to the data,
are $9.4^{+4.3}_{-2.9}\unit{fb}$ (cut-based) and $8.5^{+3.9}_{-2.6}\unit{fb}$
(BDT), a significant improvement relative to the value of
$20.8^{+11.2}_{-6.9}\unit{fb}$ of Ref.~\cite{CMS:myTOP2016}. We consider the BDT
analysis as the primary result of this paper, as it provides a higher
expected measurement precision, and use the results from it for further
interpretations in the following section.

\section{\smft interpretations}
\label{sec:ftinterpretations}
\mytodo{to reword}

The BDT-based results are used to constrain SM parameters, as well as production of
BSM particles and operators that can affect the \tttt production rate. The
existence of \tttt Feynman diagrams with virtual Higgs bosons allows
interpreting the upper limit on \xsectttt as a constraint on the Yukawa
coupling, $y_{\PQt}$, between the top quark and the Higgs
boson~\cite{THEORY:TopYukawaTTTT, THEORY:TopYukawaTTTTnew}. Similarly, the
measurement can be interpreted as a constraint on the Higgs boson oblique
parameter $\hat{H}$, defined as the Wilson coefficient of the dimension-six
BSM operator modifying the Higgs boson propagator~\cite{THEORY:ObliqueHiggs2019}.
More generically, Feynman diagrams where the virtual Higgs boson is replaced
by a virtual BSM scalar ($\phi$) or vector ($\cPZpr$) particle with mass
smaller than twice the top quark mass ($m < 2m_\PQt$), are used to interpret
the result as a constraint on the couplings of such new
particles~\cite{THEORY:Alvarez2016nrz}. In addition, new particles with $m >
2m_\PQt$, such as a heavy scalar (\PH) or pseudoscalar (\PSA), can be
produced on-shell in association with top quarks. They can subsequently decay
into top quark pairs, generating final states with three or four top quarks.
Constraints on the production of such heavy particles can be interpreted in
terms of 2HDM parameters~\cite{THEORY:Dicus1994bm,THEORY:Craig2015jba,THEORY:Craig2016ygr},
or in the framework of simplified models of dark matter~\cite{THEORY:Boveia2016mrp,
THEORY:Albert2017onk}.

\subsection{Top quark yukawa coupling}
\mytodo{to reword}

When using our \tttt to determine a constraint on $y_{\PQt}$, we verified
using a LO simulation that the signal acceptance is not affected by the
relative contribution of the virtual Higgs boson Feynman diagrams. We take
into account the dependence of the backgrounds on $y_{\PQt}$ by scaling the
\ttH cross section by $\abs{y_{\PQt}/y_{\PQt}^{\mathrm{SM}}}^2$ prior to the
fit, where $y_{\PQt}^{\mathrm{SM}}$ represents the SM value of the top quark
Yukawa coupling. As a result of the \ttH background rescaling, the measured
\xsectttt depends on $\abs{y_{\PQt}/y_{\PQt}^{\mathrm{SM}}}$, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:yukawa}. The measurement is compared to the theoretical
prediction obtained from the LO calculation of Ref.~\cite{THEORY:TopYukawaTTTT},
scaled to the $12.0^{+2.2}_{-2.5}\unit{fb}$ cross section obtained in
Ref.~\cite{THEORY:Frederix2017wme}, and including the uncertainty associated with
doubling and halving the renormalization and factorization scales. Comparing
the observed limit on \xsectttt with the central, upper, and lower values of
its theoretical prediction, we obtain 95\% \CL limits of
$\abs{y_{\PQt}/y_{\PQt}^{\mathrm{SM}}} < 1.7$, $1.4$, and $2.0$,
respectively, an improvement over the previous CMS
result~\cite{CMS:myTOP2016}. Alternatively, assuming that the on-shell Yukawa
coupling is equal to that of the SM, we do not rescale the \ttH background
with respect to its SM prediction, and obtain corresponding limits on the
off-shell Yukawa coupling of $\abs{y_{\PQt}/y_{\PQt}^{\mathrm{SM}}} < 1.8$,
$1.5$, and $2.1$. Since $y_{\PQt}$ affects the Higgs boson production cross
section in both the gluon fusion and \ttH modes, constraints on $y_{\PQt}$
can also be obtained from a combination of Higgs boson
measurements~\cite{STAT:AtlasCmsHiggsComb}. However, these constraints require
assumptions about the total width of the Higgs boson, while the \tttt-based
limit does not.

    calculated at LO and scaled to the calculation from Ref.~\cite{THEORY:Frederix2017wme}, is also plotted.

\subsection{Oblique Higgs parameter}

To calculate an upper limit of $\hat{H}$, the BDT analysis is repeated
several times using simulated samples of \tttt signal events with different
values of $\hat{H}$ to account for small acceptance and kinematic
differences. During each fit, we rescale the \ttH cross section by
$(1-\hat{H})^2$ due to its $\hat{H}$ dependency. This results in the 95\% \CL
upper limit of $\hat{H} < 0.12$. For reference, using recent LHC on-shell
Higgs boson measurements, the authors of Ref.~\cite{THEORY:ObliqueHiggs2019}
obtained a constraint of $\hat{H} < 0.16$ at 95\% \CL.


\subsection{Off-shell particles}
\mytodo{to reword}

To study the off-shell effect of new particles with $m < 2m_\PQt$, we first
consider neutral scalar ($\phi$) and neutral vector ($\cPZpr$) particles that
couple to top quarks. Such particles are at present only weakly constrained,
while they can give significant contributions to the \tttt cross
section~\cite{THEORY:Alvarez2016nrz}. Having verified in LO simulation that these
new particles affect the signal acceptance by less than 10\%, we recalculate
the \xsectttt upper limit of the BDT analysis including an additional 10\%
uncertainty in the acceptance, and obtain the 95\% \CL upper limit of
23.0\unit{fb} on the total \tttt cross section, slightly weaker than the
22.5\unit{fb} limit obtained in Section~\ref{sec:results}. Comparing this
upper limit to the predicted cross section in models where \tttt production
includes a $\phi$ or a $\cPZpr$ in addition to SM contributions and
associated interference, we set limits on the masses and couplings of these
new particles, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ZprimePhiExclusions}. These limits
exclude couplings larger than 1.2 for $m_{\phi}$ in the 25--340\GeV range and
larger than 0.1 (0.9) for $m_{\cPZpr} = 25$ (300)\GeV.

\subsection{On-shell particles}
\mytodo{to reword}

We consider on-shell effects from new scalar and pseudoscalar particles with $m > 2m_\PQt$. At such masses, the production rate of these particles
in association with a single top quark ($\PQt\PQq\PH/\PSA$, $\PQt\PW\PH/\PSA$) becomes significant,
so we include these processes in addition to $\PQt\overline{\PQt}\PH/\PSA$.
As pointed out in Ref.~\cite{THEORY:Craig2016ygr}, these processes do not suffer significant interference with the SM \tttt process.
To obtain upper limits on the sum of these processes followed by the decay $\PH/\PSA\to \ttbar$,
we use the BDT analysis and treat the SM \tttt process as a background.
Figure~\ref{fig:HiggsLimits} shows the excluded cross section as a function of the mass of the scalar (left) and pseudoscalar (right).
Comparing these limits with the Type-II 2HDM cross sections with $\tan\beta = 1$ in the alignment limit,
we exclude scalar (pseudoscalar) masses up to 470~(550)\GeV, improving by more than 100\GeV with respect to the previous CMS limits~\cite{CMS:mySUS2016}.
Alternatively, we consider the simplified model of dark matter defined in Ref.~\cite{CMS:DMsingletop},
which includes a Dirac fermion dark matter candidate, $\chi$, in addition to $\PH/\PSA$, and where the couplings of $\PH/\PSA$
to SM fermions and $\chi$ are determined by parameters $g_\mathrm{SM}$ and $g_\mathrm{DM}$, respectively.
In this model, exclusions similar to those from 2HDM are reached by assuming $g_\mathrm{SM} = 1$ and $g_\mathrm{DM} = 1$,
and taking  $m_{\PH/\PSA} < 2 m_\chi$.
Relaxing the 2HDM assumption of $\tan\beta = 1$, Fig.~\ref{fig:HiggsLimitsTB} shows the 2HDM limit as a function of $\PH/\PSA$ mass and $\tan\beta$,
considering one new particle at a time and also including a scenario with  $m_\PH = m_\PSA$ inspired by
a special case of Type-II 2HDM, the hMSSM~\cite{THEORY:Djouadi2013uqa}.
Values of $\tan\beta$ up to 0.8--1.6 are excluded, depending on the assumptions made.
These exclusions are comparable to those of a recent CMS search for the resonant production of $\PH/\PSA$ in the
$\Pp\to \PH/\PSA \to \ttbar$ channel~\cite{CMS:HIG17027}.
Relaxing the $m_{\PH/\PSA} < 2 m_\chi$ assumption in the dark matter model, Fig.~\ref{fig:DMLimits} shows the
limit in this model as a function of the masses of both $\PH/\PSA$ and $\chi$,
for $g_\mathrm{DM} = 1$ and for two different assumptions of $g_\mathrm{SM}$.
Large sections of the phase space of simplified dark matter models are excluded, and the reach of this analysis is complementary
to that of analyses
considering decays of $\PH/\PSA$ into invisible dark matter candidates, such as those of Refs.~\cite{CMS:DMsingletop, ATLAS:Aaboud2017rzf}.
